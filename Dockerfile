# The runtime used to assemble itself: node_modules from `deps`, then each
# package copied in separately from the context. That produced an image whose
# node_modules/@mercy/* entries did not resolve to the real sources, and the
# server died on startup with "Cannot find module '@mercy/protocol'" - a
# workspace symlink laid down in a stage where the packages were nothing but
# their package.json files.
#
# Copying one coherent tree costs some image size and cannot drift.
COPY --from=build /app ./

# Bun runs TypeScript directly, so the server has no build step to go stale.
